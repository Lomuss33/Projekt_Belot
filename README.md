## How to Play
1. Start the game by running the `Main` class.
2. The game will initialize with:
   - 1 Human Player.
   - 3 AI Players (based on the selected difficulty).
   - A shuffled deck of cards.
3. **Game Phases**:
   - **Card Dealing**: Players are dealt 6 cards in 3 rounds.
   - **Trump Selection**: Players choose a trump suit or skip.
   - **Gameplay**: Play cards in rounds, attempting to win tricks.
   - **Scoring**: Earn points through tricks and Zvanje combinations.
4. Play continues for 8 rounds or until a team scores 1001 points.
5. The team with the highest score wins the match!

### Additional Commands
- **Drop Mid-Game**: Use `/open run.js` to terminate the current game.
- **Trump Selection**: Use `pickTrump(0-5)` to select the trump suit (0 to skip unless last, 1-4 for suit options).
- **Card Selection**: Use `pickCard(0-8)` to play a card from your hand, depending on the number of cards.

import models.*;
import controllers.*;
import services.*;
import ai.*;

Match y = new Match(Game.Difficulty.EASY);
